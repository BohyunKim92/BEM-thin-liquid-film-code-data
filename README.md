## Figure 2 data and generating code
Data and code for generating Figure 2 is stored in "Figure2". Running "plot_GM_BEM_Fig2_dimensionless.m" will use "Figure2(a)_GM_coarse_data.dat", "Figure2(b)_BEM_coarse_data.dat", and "parameters_used_for_Fig2.dat" to generate Figure 2(a) and 2(b).
## Experimental Data
The experimetal data is stored in "Experimental_data", which have two directories storing the experimental data corresponding to Fig.4 and Fig.5 of the paper.
